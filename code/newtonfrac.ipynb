    "# Homework 4 Problem 3: Newton Fractals\n",
    "\n",
    "The sensitivity of Newtonâ€™s method to initial conditions can be studied by considering the \"basin of attractions\" of the different critical points of the function. An initial point $x_0$ belongs to the basin of attraction for a critical point $r$ if Newton's method started at point $x_0$ converges to $r.$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The way in which the different basins of attraction partition the space gives us a sense of the sensitivity of Newton's method. This is beautifully demonstrated using plots over the complex plane known as Newton fractals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code gives you a setup to easily draw the basins of attractions of Newton's method for functions defined over the complex plane -- don't worry about the complex part here, for the functions we are using the differentiation rules are the same as over the reals. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function ``newton's method(f1,f2,z)`` runs Newton's method at point $z$ on a function with first derivative ``f1`` and second derivative ``f2`` for a maximum of $40$ iterations, or until the method has converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function ``draw(f1,f2,img,size)`` creates a ``size`` by ``size`` grid of the $[-1,1] \\times [-1,1]$ square. For each node $u$ of the grid, it run Newton's method to determine the root to which it converges, if any. The point $u$ is then colored according to the root to which it converged. In this way, the basins of attraction can be visualized as colored regions on the plane.  \n",
